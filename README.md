#NUHOC Gear Locker
######A database management system for the NUHOC Gear Locker

##Technologies
The database is primarily constructed using Python, Flask, and Postgresql
To communicate with Postgresql, Python will use the SQLAlchemy library which allows for an object-oriented 'Pythonic' way of interacting with the database, as opposed to raw SQL statements in the Python code.

The project is hosted on Heroku and version controlled through GitHub
